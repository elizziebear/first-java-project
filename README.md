## first-java-project

in-class code-along where we learned to make a simple pop-up window.

### key elements

- javax.swing.JFrame & javax.swing.WindowConstants
- title of window, size, visibility, and default close operation

### folder structure

workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
